    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective date:</strong> November 5, 2025</p>

    <p>
      This document governs your use of the <strong>Covenal Wellness App</strong> ("the Service"), a complimentary
      application provided by Covenal Wellness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your privacy is important to us. This policy explains what information we collect and how we use it.
      By using our Service, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.
    </p>

    <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>
      Our app is designed to be simple and requires no user login or personal account creation.
      However, to improve our Service, we use third-party services that may collect information.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Analytics:</strong> We use <strong>Firebase Analytics</strong> to collect anonymous usage data. This helps us
        understand which features are most popular, how users interact with the app, and where we can make
        improvements. This data is aggregated and does not personally identify you.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Crash Reporting:</strong> We use <strong>Firebase Crashlytics</strong> to automatically collect information about
        crashes and errors. This helps us find and fix bugs to improve the app's stability. The reports
        include information about your device type and OS version but do not contain personal data.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>User-Generated Data (Favorites):</strong> To provide the "Favorites" feature, the app uses a local
        <strong>Room Database</strong> on your device to store the IDs of the poses you have favorited. This information
        <strong>never leaves your device</strong> and is not transmitted to us or any third party.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Service Providers</h2>
    <p>
      We employ third-party companies (Google Firebase) to facilitate our Service and perform Service-related
      analysis. These third parties have access to anonymous data only to perform the tasks assigned to them
      on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.
    </p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>
      We value your trust in providing us with information. While no method of transmission over the internet
      or electronic storage is 100% secure, we use commercially acceptable means to protect your anonymous data.
      Remember that all your personal preference data (Favorites) is stored only on your device.
    </p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      This Service does not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally
      identifiable information from children under 13.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes
      by posting the new policy on this page.
    </r>
